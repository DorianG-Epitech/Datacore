# How to play

In Datacore, you play as a character whose only objective is to survive against endless waves of enemies. The only way to defend yourself is to catch the enemy bullets with your gun and send them back to your opponents. Each time you kill an enemy, another one appears in the room, and so on until the player dies.

# Project requirements
Datacore being a school project, I  had to implement some features.

## Scenes and menus:

In Datacore, there are multiple scenes.
The main menu is the first thing you see when you launch the game, from that, you can directly start to play or you can go to the controls where you can modify volume and resolution.

In the game scene, you have two panels when you pause the game or when you die. From the death screen, you can restart the scene and retry to play.
While playing, we can see the heath bar as well as the score on the top of the screen.

## Collectibles:

There are two types of collectibles in Datacore, the first are the bullets fired by your enemies. If you don’t already have a bulle, you can âctivate your gun and aspirate the next arriving bullet. Once you have a bullet in your gun, you can fire that towards your opponents.
Everytime you kill your enemy, he will drop a heart on the floor, if you take it, you will heal yourself a little bit.

## Animations:

Every sprite you see in Datacore is designed and animated hand-made by myself. I tried to have a good variety of characters and animations.
So for the player and enemies, we have animations when idle, walking and when they take damage. The health and the camera in the menu also have animations.
